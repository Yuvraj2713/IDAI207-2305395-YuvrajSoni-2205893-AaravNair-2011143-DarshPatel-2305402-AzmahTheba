## **Project Title and Description**
### **Ripcord - A 2D Platformer with an Anger Bar Mechanic**

*Ripcord* is an engaging and challenging 2D platformer game where players must navigate levels, collect items, and battle enemies while managing an "anger bar." This unique mechanic introduces a sense of urgency, making every decision crucial. Inspired by classic platformers like *Cut the Rope*, *Ripcord* combines fast-paced gameplay with strategic resource management to create an immersive gaming experience.

### **Objectives**
- Develop a fun and strategic 2D platformer.
- Implement an innovative anger bar mechanic to drive player decisions.
- Provide an engaging, well-balanced difficulty curve.
- Optimize performance for smooth gameplay.
- Design visually appealing environments with interactive elements.
